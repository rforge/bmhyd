\details{This function fits likelihood model for continuous characters through incorporating phylogenetic network and comparative data. The new model introduces three new paramters: hybrid vigor \eqn{\beta \geq 0}, heritability factor \eqn{ 0\leq h \leq 1}, and hybrid variation \eqn{v_H \geq 0}. Current version set \eqn{h} to 0.5 as a fixed parameter. There are four possible models in this functions whcih allows some fixed values of parameters and treat others as free parameters: (1) \eqn{\beta=1, v_H=0} (2) \eqn{v_H=0, \beta} as free parameter  (3) \eqn{\beta=1, v_H} as free paramter (4) \eqn{\beta} and \eqn{v_H} are free parameters. This function returns parameter estimates and their approximated standard errors for the four models. Model averaged parameters and model averaged standard errors will also be reported. 
The R package \pkg{optimx} provides a useful and open-source library for multinational optimization. As input, \pkg{bmhyd} requires a network and a comparative data. The network must be input in \emph{eNewick format} (Cardona et al. 2008) . The comparative data is the \eqn{n} by \eqn{1} vector that contains the continuous trait of \eqn{n} species of interest.  

Mathematical Model:

Let \eqn{\bold{Y}=(y_1,y_2, ... ,y_n )} be the trait values for \eqn{n} species some of which are, possibly old,hybrids. According to the assumption of Brownian motion for trait evolution, \eqn{\bold{Y}} will follow the multivariate normal distribution \eqn{\bold{Y} \sim MVN(\bold{\mu},\bold{V}_R)} where \eqn{\bold{\mu}=(\mu_1,\mu_2,...,\mu_n )} and \eqn{\mu_i=\mu} or \eqn{\beta \mu} is the mean for usual species orthe mean for hybrid species; \eqn{\bold{V}_R = \bold{V}_R (\beta,h,\sigma^2,v_H|\bold{\aleph})} is the variance-covariance matrix, and \eqn{\bold{\aleph}} is a known network topology given with the branch lengths. The negative log likelihood function is 
\deqn{-\log L(\bold{\mu},\beta,h,\sigma^2,v_H |\bold{Y},\bold{\aleph}) = \frac{n}{2}\log 2\pi +\frac{1}{2} \log |\bold{V}d_R| 
+ \frac{1}{2} (\bold{Y}-\bold{\mu})^t \bold{V}_R^{-1}(\bold{Y}-\bold{\mu})}
where   \eqn{|\bold{V}_R|}  is the determinant of \eqn{\bold{V}_R} and   \eqn{(\bold{Y}-\bold{\mu})^t} is the transpose of \eqn{(\bold{Y}-\bold{\mu})}
For estimation of standard error of the parameter estimate, the Hessian matrix is used. The variance-covaraince matrix of the estimate of \eqn{\mu, \beta, \sigma^2, v[H]} are evaluated as the inverse of the Hessian matrix and the standard error are the squares roots of the diagonal of this matrix. 

The model average parameter and model average standard error is calculated as described in (Burham and Anderson 2004).
