Description: The BMhyd package analyze the phenotypic evolution of species of hybrid origin on a phylogenetic network. This package can detect the hybrid vigor effect, beta; a burst of variation associated with the hybridization event, V[H]; and the relative portion of heritability h from its parents. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood technique. Users need to enter comparative data in vector format and a phylogenetic network in eNewick format. The full model contains five parameters: the overeal mean mu, the overall variance sigma^2, the hibrid vigor beta, the hybrid variation v_H and the proportion of heritability h(set up to 0.5) where three submodels fix the value of beta=1 or v_H=0 or both. Those Models are also compared under Akaike Information Criterion and the model averages estimates are reported.
