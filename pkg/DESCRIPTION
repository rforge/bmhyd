Description: The BMhyd package analyzes the phenotypic evolution of species of hybrid origin on a phylogenetic network. This package can detect the hybrid vigor effect, a burst of variation at formation, and the relative portion of heritability from its parents. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. Users need to enter a comparative data set, a phylogeny, and information on gene flow leading to hybrids.
